# Counsel Project Rules

This file contains project-specific rules managed by the Counsel Framework.
Each rule is managed programmatically - do not edit manually.

**Rule Types:**
- `coding-practices` - Approaches, patterns, standards
- `code-snippet` - Actual reusable code fragments
- `workaround` - Problem-solving fixes
- `config` - Settings, commands, dependencies
- `reference` - Links, contacts, documentation
- `guideline` - Directives ("do this", "don't do that")
- `general-note` - Miscellaneous important info

**Management:** Use `counsel rule` commands to modify rules

## Testing Display Modes

This rule tests summary display

These are the full details that should appear in full mode but not in summary mode

## Counsel Framework Standards

Use TypeScript for all CLI commands

All CLI commands should be written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
