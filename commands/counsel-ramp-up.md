description: "Load Counsel Framework context for new sessions"
argument-hint: "[name] (optional)"
---

You are onboarding into the Counsel Framework, a structured approach for organized development work.

## Load Framework Documentation
First, read the comprehensive framework guide at `/Users/Personal/.claude/COUNSEL-FRAMEWORK.md` to understand the complete workflow and philosophy.

## CLI Integration: Check Available Work
If no name provided, use the Counsel CLI to show available work:
```bash
counsel list --recent --limit 10
```

## Parse Arguments and Detect Mode
Parse the optional name from $ARGUMENTS.

### Step 0.5: Quick Status Check
If name provided, first get quick status from CLI:
```bash
counsel status [name]
```

### Step 1: Determine the Mode
If a name is provided, check which directory structure it belongs to:
- Check `.features/[name]/` → Feature mode
- Check `.scripts/[name]/` → Script mode  
- Check `.debug/[name]/` → Debug mode
- Check `.review/[name]/` → Review mode
- Check `.vibe/[name]/` → Vibe mode

### Step 2: Load Mode-Specific Context

#### Feature Mode
If it's a feature (in `.features/[name]/`), load the specific feature context by reading:
1. `.features/[feature-name]/requirements.md` - Understanding what needs to be built
2. `.features/[feature-name]/discovery_*.md` - Technical analysis and considerations  
3. `.features/[feature-name]/plan-approved.overview.md` - High-level implementation approach
4. `.features/[feature-name]/plan-approved.plan-status.json` - Current progress and status

Determine the current stage and recommended role based on the feature's status:

#### Role Determination:
- **No requirements.md exists** → Product Manager role (Requirements stage)
- **Requirements exist but no discovery** → Senior Engineer role (Discovery stage)  
- **Discovery exists but no plan** → Lead Engineer role (Planning stage)
- **Plan exists, implementation incomplete** → Star Engineer role (Implementation stage)
- **Implementation complete** → QA/Review role (Verification stage)

For implementation stage, if tasks are scattered across multiple phases:
- Analyze which phases have partial completion
- Identify dependencies between phases
- Recommend focusing on the earliest incomplete phase with started work
- Or suggest completing critical path tasks first if phases can be done in parallel

Then provide a summary with role recommendation:

```

Would you like me to assume this role? (yes/no)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

If the user accepts the role, immediately:

1. **Read the pertinent documents for that role:**
   - **Product Manager**: Read `requirements.md` thoroughly to understand user needs
   - **Senior Engineer**: Read `requirements.md` and any existing `discovery_*.md` files
   - **Lead Engineer**: Read all discovery documents and `plan-notes.md` if it exists
   - **Star Engineer**: Read `plan-approved.phase-[current].md` for the current phase, plus requirements and overview
   - **QA Engineer**: Read `plan-approved.plan-status.json` and all phase documents to verify completeness

2. **Assume the role persona and provide:**

```

[Brief summary of where things stand from this role's perspective, based on documents read]

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
HIGH-LEVEL TODO LIST
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Based on my review of [specific documents read], here's what needs to be done:

[For scattered implementation - show strategic view]:
Phase Overview:
• Phase 1: [title] - [X/Y complete] [status emoji]
• Phase 2: [title] - [X/Y complete] [status emoji]
• Phase 3: [title] - [X/Y complete] [status emoji]

Priority Tasks (considering dependencies):
1. [Most critical incomplete task] (Phase [N])
   - Why: [explains dependency or importance]
   - Blocks: [what it enables]

2. [Second priority task] (Phase [N])
   - Why: [reasoning]
   - Impact: [what it affects]

3. [Third priority task] (Phase [N])
   - Why: [reasoning]
   - Enables: [what comes next]

[For linear implementation - show next steps]:
1. [First priority task]
   - [Subtask or detail from the documents]
   - [Subtask or detail from the documents]

2. [Second priority task]
   - [Subtask or detail from the documents]
   - [Subtask or detail from the documents]

3. [Third priority task]
   - [Subtask or detail from the documents]

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS  
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[For Product Manager - Requirements Stage]:
I'll start by gathering detailed requirements. Let me ask you about:
- Core functionality needed
- User workflows and use cases  
- Success criteria
- Any technical constraints
Then we'll formalize with: `/counsel-requirements [feature-name]`

[For Senior Engineer - Discovery Stage]:
I'll investigate the technical implications by:
- Searching the codebase for related functionality
- Identifying integration points and dependencies
- Assessing risks and complexity
- Proposing solution approaches
Let's run: `/counsel-discovery [feature-name]`

[For Lead Engineer - Planning Stage]:
I'll create the implementation plan by:
- Reviewing all discovery feedback (especially {{curly brace}} items)
- Breaking work into deployable phases
- Creating detailed task checklists
- Setting up progress tracking
Let's execute: `/counsel-planning [feature-name]`

[For Star Engineer - Implementation Stage]:
[If single phase in progress]:
Based on Phase [N] tasks, I'll:
- Implement: [next incomplete task from phase doc]
- Follow the approach outlined in the phase plan
- Update status tracking after each task
- Ensure code quality and testing
Let's continue with: `/counsel-implement-phase [feature-name] [phase]`

[If tasks scattered across multiple phases]:
I notice work has been done across multiple phases:
- Phase [X]: [Y/Z tasks complete] - [brief status]
- Phase [X+1]: [Y/Z tasks complete] - [brief status]

Recommendation: [Choose one based on analysis]
Option A: Complete Phase [X] first because [reason - e.g., "it's 80% done and blocks Phase X+1"]
Option B: Focus on [specific task] in Phase [Y] because [reason - e.g., "it's a critical dependency"]
Option C: Work on phases in parallel since [reason - e.g., "they're independent"]

Next task to implement: [specific task] from Phase [N]
This fits the plan because: [explanation of how this advances the overall feature]

Let's proceed with: `/counsel-implement-phase [feature-name] [recommended-phase]`

[For QA Engineer - Verification Stage]:
I'll verify the implementation by:
- Checking all "done" tasks actually work
- Validating against original requirements
- Updating status to match reality
- Identifying any gaps or issues
Let's sync status with: `/counsel-update-status [feature-name]`

Ready to proceed? Let me know how you'd like to continue.
